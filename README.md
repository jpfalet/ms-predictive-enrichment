# ms-predictive-enrichment
A generic version of the code used to estimate treatment effect in the paper by Falet et. al (2022) titled "Estimating treatment effect for individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis using deep learning." Dataset-specific code is not available as the data we used is not publically available. A minimum working example is provided with a randomly generated dataset, and the code can be easily adapted to suite most workflows.

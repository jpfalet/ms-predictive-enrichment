# ms-predictive-enrichment
Code used to estimate conditional average treatment effect for the purpose of predictive enrichment in the paper by Falet et. al (2022) titled "Estimating treatment effect for individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis using deep learning." This repository does not contain dataset-specific code, since the data we used is currently not publically available. The code we provide is meant to be provide a flexible starting point that can be adapted to suite a particular task.

# Usage
An simple implementation that uses a randomly generated dataset is provided as an example in the main() function.

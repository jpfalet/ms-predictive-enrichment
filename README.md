# ms-predictive-enrichment
Code used to estimate conditional average treatment effect for the purpose of predictive enrichment in the paper published in Nature Communications by Falet et. al (2022) titled "[Estimating individual treatment effect on disability progression in multiple sclerosis using deep learning](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33269-x)." This repository does not contain dataset-specific code, since the data we used is currently not publically available. The code we provide is meant to be provide a flexible starting point that can be adapted to suite a particular task.

# Usage
An simple implementation that uses a randomly generated dataset is provided as an example in the main() function.
